This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of the Northwind traders over time. By analyzing various aspect of this sales data i seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the NorthWind traders perfomance.This project  will demonstrate my skills in Excel and PowerBI.

## Data Sources
This data is a public data and its not in any form a real-world company data and its only used for the purpose of learning and showing my data analytic skills.

## Tools and Concept Demonstrated
- Microsoft Excel

- PowerBI
  - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations, Data Modelling, toolips, creating Dashboard report.

## Explanatory Data Analysis 
The following business questions will be answered to assist in understanding this data and making the best recommenedation posssible using Microsoft Excel.
- What is the total sales (revenue) for each category of products.
- Determine which customer has placed the highest number of orders.
- Calculate the total sales generated by each employee.
- Show the trend in sales over time.
- Calculate the average time it takes to process an order from the order date to the
shipped date.

Also I will solve the following with PowerBI building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive
team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in
key areas, including:

#### I used the function "vlookup" to get a column from a seperate table called 'categories table' and then joined it to 'orders table' for analyzing simplicity.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis on this dataset, the following are recommended:
### Revenue and Sales Optimization
### 1. Leverage the Beverage Category's Popularity:
- Expand Product Lines:Consider introducing new beverage products or variations to capitalize on its success, particularly in the USA.
- Focus marketing efforts and promotions around beverages in the USA, as this market segment demonstrates stronger performance.
- Analyze the potential to expand beverage sales into other countries where demand may be untapped.

### 2. Support High-Performing Employees:
- Recognize and reward Margaret Peacock for her exceptional sales performance. Consider using her strategies as a model for training other employees.
- Implement programs to encourage and motivate the broader sales team to improve performance.

### 3. Customer Relationship Management:
- Offer loyalty incentives to top customers like SAVEA and ERNSH to encourage continued engagement and larger order volumes.
- Build strategies to increase the customer base in the 21 countries where orders are generated. Prioritize countries with potential for growth, leveraging lessons from the USA market.

### 4. Operational Efficiency:
- Improve Shipping and Logistics: Analyze the cost-effectiveness of the shipping providers. United Package, while handling the highest number of orders (326), incurs the highest cost. - Negotiating better rates or switching to a more cost-efficient provider may improve margins.
- Address the average order processing time of 12 days. Implement systems or technologies to reduce this time, enhancing customer satisfaction and competitiveness.

### 5. Diversify Revenue Streams:
- Evaluate underperforming product Product categories to identify potential improvements or diversification opportunities.
- As the USA generates most of the profit, prioritize strategies that further strengthen this market, such as enhanced promotions or partnerships with local distributors.
- Monitor quarterly trends, such as the noticeable peak in Q1 of 2015, to prepare inventory and align marketing campaigns with high-demand periods.

#### By addressing these areas, the company can sustain its growth, maximize profitability, and build a more resilient and efficient operational model.
