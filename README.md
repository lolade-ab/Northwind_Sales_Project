### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of the Northwind traders over time. By analyzing various aspect of this sales data i seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the NorthWind traders perfomance.This project  will demonstrate my skills in Excel and PowerBI.

### Data Sources
This data is a public data and its not in any form a real-world company data and its only used for the purpose of learning and showing my data analytic skills.

### Tools and Concept Demostrated
- Microsoft Excel
  - Data cleaning, Pivot table, Functions:(sum, average, count, vlookup).
- PowerBI
  - Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations, Data Modelling, toolips, creating Dashboard report.

### Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following business questions will be answered to assist in understanding this data and making the best recommenedation posssible using Microsoft Excel.
- What is the total sales (revenue) for each category of products.
- Determine which customer has placed the highest number of orders.
- Calculate the total sales generated by each employee.
- Show the trend in sales over time.
- Calculate the average time it takes to process an order from the order date to the
shipped date.

Also I will solve the following with PowerBI building a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive
team. Its purpose should be to allow them to quickly understand the company's performance in
key areas, including:
- Sales trends
- Product performance
- Key customers
- Shipping Cost

- I used the syntax "vlookup" to get a column from a seperate table called 'categories table' and then joined it to 'orders table' for analyzing simplicity.
